# Equation Analysis Project
This project solves and analyzes non-linear equations using Python libraries like Sympy, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

## Features
- Dynamically constructs and solves equations.
- Finds roots of the equation symbolically.
- Plots the function behavior on a graph.
- Conducts stability and sensitivity analysis.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
2. Run the script:
## Output
- The program displays:
- Roots of the equation.
- Stability analysis results.
- Sensitivity analysis graphs.
